load test, module built as intended

kernel newer
module built against higher revision: 999, loading into 1
bogus4: built against 1 revision 999
module built against higher revision: 999, loading into 1
bogus4: built against 1 revision 999
kernel newer (lazy)
module built against higher revision: 999, loading into 1
bogus4: built against 1 revision 999
load lazy ./bogus4.so 
          ^ ? "./bogus4.so": already loaded, replacing
module built against higher revision: 999, loading into 1
bogus4: built against 1 revision 999
done

loading with unresolved symbol
load ./bogus1.so
     ^ ? ./bogus1.so: undefined symbol: VERY_DIFFERENT_INTERFACE
lazy loading with unresolved symbol
trying to call undefined symbol
load lazy ./bogus1.so
          ^ ? ./bogus1.so: undefined symbol: VERY_DIFFERENT_INTERFACE

loading without "interface_name".
fails for backwards compatibility.
load ./bogus2.so
     ^ ? ./bogus2.so: undefined symbol: gnucap_uf_interface_99999
detach ./bogus2.so
       ^ ? plugin not attached
now lazy
module built against 99999, this is 1
unloading
unloading twice
detach ./bogus2.so
       ^ ? plugin not attached

too old kernel (should fail)
module built against lower revision: 0, loading into 1
bogus3: loading, although kernel revision higher
module built against lower revision: 0, loading into 1
bogus3: loading, although kernel revision higher
